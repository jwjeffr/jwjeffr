### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacob and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Materials Science and Engineering in the [MUEXLY group](https://github.com/muexly) at Clemson University. I am also a graduate student in the [Theoretical Division](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/index.php) at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

ðŸŒŸ I specialize in:

- Monte Carlo methods
- Molecular dynamics
- Multi-scale modeling
- Statistical mechanics

I am also an officer for Clemson University's premier Esports organization: Clemson Esports. Here, I take on more traditional software engineering projects, such as creating and maintaining bots for the organization's Discord.

ðŸŒ± I am currently working on:

- Transport and grain boundary segregation in High Entropy Alloys 
- Non-equilibrium vacancy transport in tungsten
- Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of organic nanocrystalline growth
